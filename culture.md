# INTRODUCTION - This page is unfinished

Culture is a system of beliefs, values, and assumptions about life that guide behavior and are shared by a group of 
people. It includes customs, language, and material artifacts. These are transmitted from generation to generation, 
rarely with explicit instructions.

In addition to its intrinsic value, culture provides important social and economic benefits. With improved learning, 
increased tolerance, and opportunities to come together with others, culture enhances our quality of life and 
increases overall well-being for both individuals and communities.

To this end it is important to create a work environment where those who want to grow, and are prepared to commit to it,
are able to do so.

# DESCRIPTION

There is no assumption of what the culture in any given team should or will be.  It is important to understand that the 
purpose of Kanban-Zai is not to dictate to a team about how they should act and behave.  

Adopting Kanban-Zai should not impose a cultural change upon your team.  You work how you work, you like what you like. 
Kanban-Zai should be thought of as the glue that binds different parts of the puzzle together and most importantly 
to present an objective perspective to all members of the team.

## VALUES

### PEOPLE

People fail, are unreliable, don't communicate well, feel they are not up to the task, like to blame others, make
mistakes, do things wrong, have lives outside the team and are not robots.  So what. Get used to it, and extend 
your teams adoption of Kanban-Zai to accomodate the quirks of your current team.  If your team changes, you may have
to modify your implementation.

It is the humans that provide the power to the process.  They can only do that if individual efforts are 
collectively, focused through the lens of the process.  Said another way, team members must WANT to be working on 
a Kanban-Zai team and the team needs people.

### VOICE
Your VOICE matters to the team, that is why you are there!  No team can function without information.  The only place a 
team can get expert information from is other team members.  That's actually the whole point of a team.  The ultimate 
outcome of any information flow throughout the team is consensus and consensus cannot be said to have been reached if 
some voting participants don't know what they are voting for because they have not heard your voice.

### BALANCE
The team must strive for balance.  When a team has members who have an existing rapport the information exchange 
between them can be very high, however other members of the team may not get the same amount of information from the 
exact same conversation.  Conversely, new team members may be saying a lot but not relaying much information to anyone
or worse may be going over ground everybody just covered.  So the team MUST listen and intuitivley interperet.
   
### ACCESSIBILITY

Make all sources of information accessible.

A team must work hard on this aspect of culture. Otherwise all team members are not equal participants in the team and
it is very important that all members have equal standing.  Some may be less experienced with the subject matter or
less skilled in some aspect of the project or have entirely different skills than others.  Or they might speak French.

Regardless they must all have access to the same information, the same reasoning, the same goal set, as everyone else.

This is fairly easy to achieve with code, processes and documentation but much harder if the information is in different
brains.  Therefore private list of jobs are expressly forbidden in Kanban-Zai
