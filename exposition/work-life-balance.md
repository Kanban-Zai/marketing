I don’t care whether you come into the office at 10am.

I don’t care if you choose to work from home or not.

I don’t care if you work from the garage while they fix your car.

I hired you for a job and I trust you to get it done. Just let me know what you need from me to be successful in your role and I will show up for you.

Life happens!

You don’t need to justify to me why you need a day off.

You don’t need to explain how sick your child is to leave early.

You don’t need to apologise for having a personal life.

Yes, I care about results but I also care about you. We are all human and we are all adults. I lead people. I don’t run an adult day care centre.
