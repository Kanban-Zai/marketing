# Trust

Trust is hard but inherent in every single human interation.  Development teams are no different.  A lot goes on
in a development team wether it be code or conversation it will never see the light of day but it will be part of
the mountain of work that happens to produce the final product that everybody does see.

Trust is the grease between the cogs that keeps everything running smoothly.

Kanban-Zai attempts to increase trust in a team by solving 2 problems

    1. Shielding the team from external politcs by placing a process between them and the business entity 
       that is funding the team.
       
    2. By mitigating the hidden, most times unwittingly, politics that go on internally.
