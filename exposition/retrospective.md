# Retrospectives...huh?

Traditionally Agile retrospectives are complex and misunderstood beasts.  They do serve a valid purpose but for the most part 
people miss the point.  They are about increasing consisitency and reliabilty.  The default stance of the perople in the room is usually 
to think that the reason for the retrospective is because the people in the room messed up in someway. so there is a lot of focus on team
bonding in retrospectives but additionally they are usually catch alls for everything that went on in a sprint and leave a wake of 
confusion.  

Additionally there is a dogmatic focus on getting an "action" out of a retrospective.  Which never gets done.  Over time this 
errodes confidence in the process.  So we get into a situation where nobody has confidence in the process that is meant to nurture
reliability within the team.

In reality retrospectives are named incorrectly.  They should be named the STEERING WHEEL.

Before reliability breaks down, it's important to address it immediately
* Establish how far off track is the outcome
* Explain the impact
* Ideate with them about how to do things differently the next time. 
* Do this without using accusatory "you" language.
