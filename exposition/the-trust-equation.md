The Trust Equation

The thing about trust is that it's so fundamental that it's often overlooked as the issue at hand, if you're able to see
 how important it is in every interaction, that's a big advantage.

When people don’t trust you, it becomes obvious in their behaviour. They double-check your work, they micromanage you, 
and they don’t invite you to confidential meetings.

The Trust Equation  = (C+R+I) / SO

CREDIBILITY - has to do with the words we speak. In a sentence we might say, 
              “I can trust what she says about intellectual property; she’s very credible on the subject.”

RELIABILITY - has to do with actions. We might say, “If he says he’ll deliver the product tomorrow, I trust him, 
              because he’s dependable.”

INTIMACY- refers to the safety or security that we feel when entrusting someone with something. We might say, 
           “I can trust her with that information; she’s never violated my confidentiality before, and she would never 
           embarrass me.”

SELF-ORIENTATION - refers to the person’s focus. In particular, whether the person’s focus is primarily on him or 
                    herself, or on the other person. We might say, “I can’t trust him on this deal — I don’t think 
                    he cares enough about me, he’s focused on what he gets out of it.” Or more commonly, 
                    “I don’t trust him — I think he’s too concerned about how he’s appearing, so he’s not really 
                    paying attention.”
