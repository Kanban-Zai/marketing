# How to build trust in Kanban-Zai

Building trust in Kanban-Zai is simple.  It is based on output.

The definition of output is more or less the same in Kanban-Zai as it is in Agile or any other project management system.  The main difference is the trust is build 
on a "Adhoc per card" basis.  Each card a person completes builds a small bit of incremental trust.  Regardless of what is on the card.  This is not to different than 
the way humans adhocly measure anything, wether it be them drawing a line on paper, typing a letter or running a race.  The proceedure is simple. 
Incremental action, measure output, repeat.

In this fashion any new member to the team has a practical and understandable way to build trust amongst the existing team members, who all would have to go through 
this process and still continually do.

It is important in Kanban-Zai that all work be fed through the process and that everybody involved follows the process.  This requires a disciplined approach to the
work.  Which means if in your opinion there is work that must be done wether it be fixing something, improving something, tidying something or removing something
then don't do it, card it up and put it in the backlog.


## If trust gets broken how do you get back to where you were?

Sanctioning is normally not nessacary as interpersonal politics takes care of it.  The best way is to just remind everyone to stick to the process and carry on.


## Don't let you drag the process down

Sometimes you need to deviate from the process,  because there is an emergency or you know there is a problem but you don't know what it is or for any other reason.
In these cases dogmatically adhering to the process may be a hinderance....or is it?  I this case the process allows you to refer to your teams norms, specifically 
the "COWBOY" team norm.
