Expostion About Team-Norms


## WHAT ARE TEAM NORMS?

These direct the day to day behaviour of your team.  They will likely be different for each and every team, although there could be common themes.

* Team norms as decided on by the team and changed via a deviation.  
* They define the operational boundaries of team culture ( no need for HR )
* New people coming in should be familiarised with them
* they should be splattered all over the walls so they can be pointed at by anyone at any time.  
* Overtime they define the team culture.

## REQUIRED KANBAN-ZAI TEAM NORMS

#### QUORUM OVERRIDES

To keep everything running with as little overhead as possible a quorum team members can override
all team and card settings except the team norms which maybe changed by running a deviation.  The definition
of a quorum in Kanban-Zai is this.  To vote there must be the number of team members present that could in theory 
achieve a majority vote otherwise no binding vote must be taken.

#### NO ABSTAINING

You may not abstain from a vote you are present for.

#### NO SURPRISES

The definition of surprise is an action taken or a decision made or an outcome made visible in the absence of 
evidence for such action, decision or outcome.  Don't do it.  You will be glad you listened.

#### SANCTIONS

A audit is not a punishment or a reward.  It is a record of a team member deviating from the team norms or going 
out of bounds of a card or breaking the bounds of Kanban-Zai in some fashion.  

This is neither a good or bad thing by itself.  For example many experienced developers break protocol all the time
as do many inexperienced developers.  Additionally maybe your team requires someone like this or really wants to run
a tight ship.

As a team you are required to record audits, but only with a QUORUM. It should never be recorded why a team member is
working for you currently or no longer working for you.

#### BACKPORTING
In many cases cards are generally estimates (guesses) of what needs to be done.  You just dont know what you dont know 
sometimes.  However during the course of the work you may drop something, add something or change something about 
the card.  Record this change, split out new cards or combine existing ones.  The goal of backporting is for the card 
to represent what was done rather than what was asked for.


## OPTIONAL TEAM NORMS AND EXTENDING KANBAN-ZAI

Team Norms are your path to making Kanban-Zai fit your team, and even change with the team and the times.
Here are a few that you can adopt when you first begin with Kanban-Zai.  Longer term they may not fit, but in the
beginning they will help a lot.


 
#### TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT
This is a very formal setting which requires all developers to be disciplined.  It adds technical debt in the form of
 tests and in the form of code depending on your settings. 
 How this is implemented will have a very big impact on your team.


## Summary
Obviously this is going to require some negotiation with the team do keep your changes visible and get consensus.
