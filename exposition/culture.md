# Hints and tips on culture

Listed are annecdotal experiences and general wisdom and thinking from society as a whole to help you along your 
cultural journey.

* reinforce reliability as a cultural value, most reliability issues between people can be boiled down to poor 
  communication, which is easily fixed
* Be ok with failure, do it often
* Be proactive about genuinley and generously giving credit to others
* Don't let blame blind you
* Don't wait to share bad news or ask for help
* Don't surprise people with decisions or problems out of the blue
* Don't surprise people, full stop.

### This is how you destroy a team real quick!

Trust is hard, once broken it is hard to fix.  This document does not address a personality that is hostile to 
the team.  Hostile personalites like this usually do not exist within a team and are generally a threat from without
 easy to spot and as long as the process is being followed, managable.

Problems that tear down teams all come from the inside, and most times nobody even is aware of it happening until
it is too late, if they even see it at all.

To keep it simple Kanban-Zai and categorizes these internal problems into 2 groups.

1. Anybody who favours their own view over the teams and has an inability or unwilliness to negotiate a consensus.
    
2. Anybody who chooses to not adhere to the process, including team norms, forms a clique 
(political collusion, a problem because now 1 person has > 1 votes) or surprises the team regularly.
    
Both of these can be addressed and corrected by the normal team process and by highlighting the problems.  Both of these
things will happen from time to time and generally they are part of normal human behaviour and not intentionally 
neafarious.  Inaction can let these behaviours take on a life of their own so action must be taken quickly however it
must not be personal.  Personally calling out a person on such behaviours are actually an attack on the team as they 
build resentment.

The Kanban-Zai way to deal with both situations is to record a journal.


## Other non audital behaviours that are more appropriatley addressed through team norms.
* Multiple hat wearers.
* Isolation and silos.
* Abuse of goodwill.
* Overly enthusiastic people.
* People affected to much by impostor syndrome - causes very defensive behaviours
* People not affected enough by impostor syndrome - causes very offensive behaviours
