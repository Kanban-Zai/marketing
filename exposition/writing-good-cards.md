# how to write the perfect card.

The simple answer is you can't.

The longer answer is that cards are in a very similar category to documentation in 
that it is very easy for them to carry stale information.

Cards therefore should always be, stealing directly from agile here,
"an excuse for a converstion"

The more cards there are the great the risk of staleness.

## A set of rules to put a card into play

* A definition of done to constrain the depth of work

* don't surprise anyone with the outcome.
