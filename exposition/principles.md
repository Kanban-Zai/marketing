# THE PYRAMID OF PRINCIPLES

The principles of Kanban-Zai are a pyramid with objectivity at the peak.

                                OBJECTIVITY
                         TRUST | CONSENSUS | EVIDENCE
       VISIBILITY | DISCIPLINE | CONSISTIENCY | FEEDBACK | PRIORITY

Collaboration can be a very subjective world as it brings together people from, many, different walks of life.  
Different people have different ideas.  It is very easy for personal bias to creep into any process and objectivity
suffers.  If objectivity suffers you can just flip the pyramid upside down to see what happens. 

       VISIBILITY | DISCIPLINE | CONSISTIENCY | FEEDBACK | PRIORITY
                         TRUST | CONSENSUS | EVIDENCE
                                OBJECTIVITY  <---- Crumbling objectivity = A bad day for everyone

Objectivity, as well as all the other principles, must be constantly maintained.  Lose one, lose all.
