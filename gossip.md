## Gossip

What is gossip?

[An industry example of how gossip works](https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/55426/how-does-something-become-common-knowledge)

So, can gossip help a team to collaborate?

People are resistant to thinking about gossip as anything but a bad behavior, and there are some types of gossip that 
should be avoided, such as gossip that is purely harmful and serves no greater purpose — like mean comments about 
someone’s looks.

Studies have found that gossip can facilitate bonding and closeness and serve as a form of entertainment.  So, keep on 
talking. And when your conversation turns to gossip, as it inevitably will, remember that some good can come of it, 
with the right intentions, of course.

Gossip encourages social bonding. The people you gossip with become part of a group -- everyone else is outside of your 
group.  Gossip can play a lot of different roles in social interactions.  The people you chose to gossip with are people you trust not 
to use the information that you're sharing against you.

Gossiping is enjoyable and when gossiping, people:

* Entertain each other
* Influence one another's opinions
* Exchange important information
* Point out and enforce social rules
* Learn from others' mistakes
