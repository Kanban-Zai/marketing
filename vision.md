# INTRODUCTION - This page is unfinished

The purpose of vision is to take the idea proposition of the client and form it into 
* A value proposition
* A viability model
* A product backlog

# DESCRIPTION

`A value proposition` is a simple statement that summarizes why a customer would choose your product or service. A great 
value proposition may highlight what makes you different from competitors, but it should always focus on how customers 
define your value. 

* Clear
* Concise
* Obvious 
* Adaptable
* Scalable
* Justifiable

`A viability model` describes appetite of the market for the proposition, the capability of the underlying technology 
and the business model of the proposition.

Put plainly a "viability model" is working out what the team will build both conceptually and actually.  This will
involve deep discussions with the client where many of their ideas must be respectfully but robustly challenged.  The 
purpose of the challenge is not to discount an idea but to draw out a full accounting of an idea.  These ideas must be
channelled through thought tools.  These tools are deliberately manual and deliberately public.  The entire vision team
must be involved in this part of the process.

`A product backlog` describes the order in which the parts of the product will launch to the client.  The client can
then choose when to launch to market.

The product backlog is a list of work defined in in epics.  Epics are an arbitrary amount of work about one topic.  
There must be an approximate cost attatched.  this will generally be a large cost

## Method

Dur

A
by biting off chunks of the idea and 
producing [epics](https://github.com/Kanban-Zai/kanban-zai-core/blob/main/exposition/what-are-epics.ms) 


 
The time spent doing this is determined by the [PREDICTION SETTING](https://github.com/Kanban-Zai/kanban-zai-core/blob/main/extensions/setting-predictions.md) but the method is the same.

This process must consider 3 things.

1. The Technology
2. The Business Model
3. The Zeitgeist
 
### Technology
This is less actual technology and more capability. Sometimes we are talking tech, sometimes it could be a 100 monkeys
locked in a room with typewriters.  Both are a form of automation, both provide a capability, both are scalable,
both require no extrodinary special skill on the part of the business entity.  All that matters is what can be done and
what cannot be done and how that fits the business model and the market.

### The Business Model
Plain and simple. How is this idea going to be monetized.

### The Zeitgeist
Meaning the ghost of the times it is made up of things like Market Fit, Public Appitite for the idea, The Problem 
being solved and other subjective ideas.
 
## The Golden Halo

If you imagine these 3 ideas represented by a Zen Diagram.  Inside each ring of the diagram you write the pros
and cons of the idea based on the ring they are in.  Will the market accept the idea, is the market desperate for it,
where will the technology break down, will the business model constrain the technology?  All these things must be 
considered and arranged into the diagram.  Negatives push the rings apart and positives pull the rings together.  If
all 3 rings align exactly ontop of one another then you have achieved the GOLDEN HALO and you are onto a guaranteed winner.

More often than not this will not happen and you will now be considering..."The Zen Diagram of fuckedness"

                      Business model --- Technology
                                  Zeitgeist

The viable part of your idea sits at the intersection of the 3 rings.  The larger the intersection the more viable the 
idea.  The goal is to make that intersection as large as possible and fit as much in there as possible THAT IS RELEVANT
to the idea at hand.  Only this way can you get a clear picture.

Of course the Z.D.O.F is a communication concept rather than a magical measuring tool.  Discovering the viability and
realizing and idea are a hard problem that generally requires multiple collaborators.  Do not minimise lightly this part
 of the process.  
 
As the saying goes.  The feet walk where the eyes lead.  It does not work that well the other way around. 

### Descoping.
At this point there will be a product starting to form.  To build an epic you must now winnow it down to just the 
important parts and remove everthing that is not important.

Budget must also be managed as part of the vision.  Epics must be assigned budgets and both aggreed with the client 
before handing off to the scheduling team.  At this point only a ballpark figure should be set on the amount of time
it will take to execute this epic.  There also should be no delivery date aggreed but a priority of 1-3 should be set.

    How far in advance should the vision team speculate?
