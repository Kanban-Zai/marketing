# INTRODUCTION - This page is unfinished

Kanban-Zai is a collaboration process.  

Conceptually the larger team is separated into 3 teams.

* Vision team       - Responsible for constraining the over-arching path the team takes.
* Scheduling Team     - Responsible for maintaining the schedule of work.
* Execution Team    - Responsible for taking a backlog of work and creating a product.

# DESCRIPTION

## The Scheduling Team
Another saying goes the best laid plans of mice and men...refering to how plans can go wrong
But you actually have to have a plan first in order for it to go wrong.  That's where this team comes in.

Epics come in and listed in priority order.  They are broken down into sensible sized chunks and put into the backlog.
These chunks are listed in execution order.

### Breakdown
