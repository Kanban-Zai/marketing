### documentation

Usually, in most business enterprises, common knowledge is written down in documentation to facilitate the passing of
such knowledge to the subsequent iteration of employees, but more often it is not written down at all.

Any form of written documentation must be considered Technical Debt.  It is out of date very quickly and a chore to 
maintain, and it is a skill to write good documentation, the implication being that documentation is only as good as
the person writing it, the skill of the person reading it and if it is current.  

For example:-
 
The best written portugese document is completely useless to an english only speaker and likewise the documentation 
for the operation of a nuclear plant would be dangerous in the hands of those uneducated in nuclear power plants.

Another consideration is the sheer amount of documentation that can build up, that takes a very long time to sift
through manually and search engines often make the problem worse, not better because the searcher usually is
uncertain of what they are even looking for and if they were they wouldn't need to search.

From one perspective documentation can be considered a subjective dangerous waste of time and from a another perspective 
a useful and necessary part of any system.

The key is to find a balance, with the emphasis on minimising the amount of documentation that ever needs to be written
and actively retiring as much documentation as you can as fast as you can.

Kanban-Zai only mandates one thing with respect to documentation.__  If you choose to maintain a cache of documenation
for your software then maintaining it MUST be part of your teams definition of done.

Further than that Kanban-Zai discourages documentation as a general rule.  In certain cases documentation is the 
correct tool for the job but doesn't usually scale well.
