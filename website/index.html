    <h1>What is Kanban-Zai and why is it needed?</h1>

    <p>These days "Automation" is the mantra of many businesses.  In these times it is easy to forget that it is humans who
    are running the show.  Humans do not always gel together as well as they could and are not all at the same level of
    knowledge or experience in life.</p>

    <p>This last statement is often countered with "My company only hires the best people".   Well.  Assuming the person
    saying that believes it to be a truthful statement then the counter question would be "who do google, facebook, apple
    and microsoft have?"</p>

    <p>The reality is you probably are not hiring what you consider the best people, and the term "best people" is somewhat of
    a fallacy.  People are different, dont always see eye to eye and have followed a different path through life.
    Kanban-Zai takes the view that this is THE ASSET that any team wants, people with a different perspective.</p>

    <p>Where there are people there are politics.  Politics is great when out in the open.  In-fact it can generate robust
    team narrative and lead to a better consensus.  More than that, politics in the open can be reined in if those politics
    become not about the team narrative.</p>

    <p>When politics becomes subversive and not openly disscussed it can very quickly erode trust and objectivity because
    a part of the team (more than one person) is now colluding against another part of the team, in the shadows.</p>

    <p>If this happens your team is done.  The nastiness of it will ebb and flow as people leave and new people arrive. Infact
    this personel churn-over is one of the traditional metrics of determine problems in an organisation or team.  However,
    once the rot sets in it is very difficult to remove.</p>

    <p>one of the two primary ideas behind Kanban-zai core is to protect a team from this scenario.  To protect a team
    from itself.</p>

    <p>The second of those primary ideas is to protect the team from politics external to the team.  This is not a new idea
    and many forms of agile account for this already, with varying degrees of success.</p>

    <h1>Principles</h1>
    The principles of Kanban-Zai are a pyramid with objectivity at the peak.

    OBJECTIVITY
    TRUST | CONSENSUS | EVIDENCE
    VISIBILITY | DISCIPLINE | CONSISTIENCY | FEEDBACK | PRIORITY

    Collaboration can be a very subjective world as it brings together people from, many, different walks of life.
    Different people have different ideas.  It is very easy for personal bias to creep into any process and objectivity
    suffers.  If objectivity suffers you can just flip the pyramid upside down to see what happens.

    VISIBILITY | DISCIPLINE | CONSISTIENCY | FEEDBACK | PRIORITY
    TRUST | CONSENSUS | EVIDENCE
    OBJECTIVITY  <---- Crumbling objectivity = A bad day for everyone

    Objectivity, as well as all the other principles, must be constantly maintained.  Lose one, lose all.
